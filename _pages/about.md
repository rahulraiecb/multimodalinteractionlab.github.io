I am a PhD student in Neuroscience program at the University of British Columbia, department of psychiatry. I am located at the djavad mowafaghian center for brain health within UBC Hospital.
At work, I develop computational tools and collaborate with coworkers to explore relation between brain and behavior with in vivo imaging. With an engineering background in computer science, I am interested in building novel tools and platforms to address neuroscientific problems in health and disease. My research involves neuronal calcium imaging, closed-loop neurofeedback using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to investigate plasticity and learning.

Traveling and anything outdoors, mountains and water excite me. I love meeting new people, learning about them, their culture and food.
